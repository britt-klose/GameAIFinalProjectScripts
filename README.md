- The goal of this project is to integrate different types of AI-enabled enemies into the 3D Game Kit package.
- The primary character, Ellen, has already been established in the kit. Ellen explores a strange planet, encountering various enemies like Spitter, Chomper, and Grenadier, all of which are relatively complex but pre-configured NPCs.
- The focus of this project is to introduce new, unique enemies with intelligent behaviors and interactions with Ellen and the game environment.
- These enemies will need to exhibit dynamic AI behavior, including interactions with Ellen and environmental elements, as well as the ability to navigate the environment using AI navigation (NavMeshAgent).
